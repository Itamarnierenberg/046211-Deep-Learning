Some weights of the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k were not used when initializing ViTModel: ['pooler.dense.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ViTModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ViTModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
